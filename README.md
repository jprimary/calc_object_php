# calc_object_php

This is a simple calculator using Object Oriented Programming in PHP.

To make it work create a "classes" folder and paste there the files:
- adder.php
- calculator.php
- divider.php
- multiplier.php
- operatorinterface.php
- subtractor.php

Leave the other two files in "root".

I hope it is useful to you.
